## User Experience

### General Concept

![OG Passport](http://chandleroleary.com/wp-content/uploads/chandler_oleary_natl_park_passport_3.jpg)

Wilderness Passport is a full CRUD web application, designed to allow users to get the most out of their favorite National Parks. Users will be able to find parks near them, add their "stamps" to their passport, and see news, alerts, and articles about their favorite parks. In Phase 2, a user will be able to plan a trip to a park, and other users will be able to search for users near them who are planning trips.

### User Stories

From the user's perspective on first signing up, they will be able to search for parks either by name or by ZIP code. Upon finding a park they like, they will be able to add that park to their passport, selecting whether they want to visit or they have already visited.

Once a user has at least one park in their passport, they will be able to see alerts pertaining to that park. 

They will also be able to edit their passport parks to indicate whether they've visited or not, and add new parks that they've visited or are interested in.

In further phases, users will be able to plan trips to parks in their passport, as well as have an overall articles page with news about the National Parks. Afterward, other users will be able to find users' trips near them.
